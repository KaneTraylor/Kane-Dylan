Azure blue: 3399fe

Mint green: 1fd4c6

Font : Panton Black Caps

The font is the one I like a lot for the tides, if we could make intro header that font id nut. I think it's <h5>? maybe 4.

If we could use the colors listed above for some of the background colors, or small image colors that would be sick.

If you could make the "sign up" on the navbar a button id also nut

I'd really like it if the navbar wasnt so much shit but i haven't decided what to do with it exactly.
  
  If the sign up button could redirect to a dummy sign up form that's the main goal right now. If we can copy the UI of kovo sign up form even better.
